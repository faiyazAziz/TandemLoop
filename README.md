### **Problem 2: Odd Series Generator**
- Generates a series of odd numbers up to a specified number `a`.
- **File**: `Program-2.py`

**Example Usage**:  
```bash
Enter a number: 4  
Output: 1, 3, 5, 7
```

---

### **Problem 3: Modified Odd Series Generator**
- Generates a modified series of odd numbers based on specific rules:
  - If `a` is even, return the odd series for `a - 1`.
  - If `a` is odd, return the odd series for `a`.
- **File**: `Program-3.py`

**Example Usage**:  
```bash
Enter a number: 5  
Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
```
